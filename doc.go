# Synopsis

The Senzing sz-sdk-go packages contain definitions that are common to implementations of the Senzing Go SDK.

# Overview

The Senzing sz-sdk-go implementations enable Go programs to call Senzing library functions.
Under the covers, Golang's CGO is used by the sz-sdk-go packages to make the calls
to the Senzing C library functions.
